Quick Deployment Steps

1. Create a GitHub Repository
	1.	Go to GitHub
	2.	Repository name: melbourne-parking-dashboard
	3.	Set it to Public (required for the free GitHub Pages plan)
	4.	Do not initialize with a README (we already have one)
	5.	Click “Create repository”

2. Push Code to GitHub

# Run in the melbourne-parking-dashboard directory
git remote add origin https://github.com/Only-Bugs/melbourne-parking-dashboard.git
git push -u origin main

3. Enable GitHub Pages
	1.	Go to your GitHub repository
	2.	Click the “Settings” tab
	3.	Scroll to the “Pages” section
	4.	For Source, select “Deploy from a branch”
	5.	Choose the main branch and ”/ (root)” folder

Connecting to AWS RDS Database (Optional)

If you want to connect to live AWS RDS data:

Step 1: Deploy AWS Lambda API

# Make sure AWS CLI is installed and configured
aws configure

# Deploy the Lambda function
./aws-lambda-deploy.sh

Step 2: Create API Gateway
	1.	Log in to the AWS Console
	2.	Go to the API Gateway service
	3.	Create a REST API: parking-dashboard-api
	4.	Create resources:
	•	/restrictions (GET method)
	•	/stats (GET method)
	5.	Integrate with your Lambda function: parking-dashboard-api
	6.	Enable CORS
	7.	Deploy to the prod stage

Step 3: Update API Configuration

Edit js/dashboard.js:

// Update this line
this.apiBaseUrl = 'https://your-actual-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod';

Push the update:

git add js/dashboard.js
git commit -m "Update API URL for AWS RDS connection"
git push origin main
